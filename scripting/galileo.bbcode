Here you can find an easter egg from Brad:
[URL="https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Galileo"] https://wiki.alliedmods.net/Galileo[/URL]

It is a good start to use it within this new version, but as just it do not cover all current
features, see this whole thread and the "[B]galileo.cfg[/B]" file contents for full speficiation.

The original plugin [URL="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=77391"]Galileo[/URL] is written by [B]Brad[/B]. This Galileo works as the original [B]Galileo[/B].
Moreover this [B][COLOR="Blue"]Galileo[/COLOR][/B] has also special features for the [URL="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=273020"]Multi-Mod Manager[/URL] plugin and
it stills can be used all alone. See the [goanchor=Change]Change Log[/goanchor] and [goanchor=Credits]Credits[/goanchor] for more details.


It is [COLOR="Red"][B]highly recommended[/B][/COLOR] you to review the well-commented "[B]galileo.cfg[/B]" to see
all the cvars' options you have with this plugin.  It's located in the [B]Attached ZIP[/B]

// 4 - dynamic "rockthe<anything>vote" command (allows a player to type
//     any one word (i.e. no spaces) that starts with "rockthe" and ends
//     with "vote". Some examples might be: "rockthedamnvote",
//     "rockthesillylittlevote", or "rockthefreakingvote". The total
//     length of the word can not be longer than 31 characters. That
//     leaves 20 characters for creativeness once you factor in the
//     lengths of "rockthe" and "vote")
// 5 - Same as 1 and 4 at the same time.
// 6 - Same as 2 and 4 at the same time.
// 7 - Same as 1, 2 and 4 at the same time.
gal_rtv_commands 7

// Specifies the number of minutes after a map starts that players
// have to wait before they can rock the vote. When a single player
// is on the server, that player can rock the vote at any time,
// regardless of this setting.
gal_rtv_wait 10

// Specifies the number of rounds after a map starts that players
// have to wait before they can rock the vote. When a single player
// is on the server, that player can rock the vote at any time,
// regardless of this setting. If you use both 'mp_timelimit > 0' and
// 'mp_maxrounds > 0', this cvar will be ignored and the cvar 'gal_rtv_wait'
// will be used instead of this.
gal_rtv_wait_rounds 5

// Specifies the number of frags after a map starts that players
// have to wait before they can rock the vote. When a single player
// is on the server, that player can rock the vote at any time,
// regardless of this setting. If you use both 'mp_timelimit > 0',

// and the cvar 'gal_rtv_wait' will be used instead of this.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Runoff voting happens when none of the normal vote options receive //
// over 50% of a given vote. The two options with the highest vote    //
// counts will be in the runoff vote.                                 //
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Indicates whether to allow runoff voting or not.
//
// 0 - disable runoff voting
// 1 - enable runoff voting
gal_runoff_enabled 1

// Specifies the number of seconds the runoff vote should last.
gal_runoff_duration 15

// Specifies the minimum amount of votes the most voted map should have
// to not start a run off voting. For example, setting it to 0.4 will
// cause a runoff to start if the most voted map does not get
// 0.4*100% = 40% of the votes. The basic formula to start it is:
//
//     numberOfVotesAtFirstPlace <= g_totalVotesCounted * gal_runoff_ratio
//
// If the most voted map does not receive at lest these votes percentage,
// a runoff voting is performed.
gal_runoff_ratio 0.5

// Specifies the number of maps players can choose from during the runoff
// vote. The number of maps must be between 2 and 9. This count includes
// the options `Stay Here` and `Extend Map`.
// Now the voting take may into account all the map options that had the
// maximum amount of votes, i.e., the number of maps to be included in
// runoff voting. So someone could choose  to have two, three or maybe
// all maps with the highest number of votes in runoff voting.
//
// Note:
// Not all your runoff voting's will use all these maps. This will only
// happen when there are several high and equally voted maps.
// For example, if this cvar is set to 9 and there are 9 maps in voting,
// and only 7 of them get one vote, only those 7 maps will be present on
// the runoff vote.
gal_runoff_mapchoices 2



////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Weighted votes allows admins to have their vote counted as more    //
// than a regular player's vote.                                      //
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// Specifies how many votes a single admin vote should count as. A value

// Specifies the standard access flags needed to have weighted votes.
// You can specify multiple flags.
gal_vote_weightflags "y"



////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
// Ending a map on a new round after time has expired, for round-     //
// based mods, is a much nicer way of ending the current map than the //
// standard HL1 way, which is to suddenly end the map the second time //

// 0 - end immediately when time runs out
// 1 - when time runs out, end at the current round end
// 2 - when time runs out, end at the next round end
gal_endonround 1

// Indicates when a map should end after the RTV voting is finished.
// If selected a value higher than 0, this cvar indicates also the players
// minimum number necessary to allow the last round to be finished when
// the time runs out.
// For example, if this cvar value is set to 2, and there are only 1 player

gal_endonround_rtv 1

// Indicates how to announce the last round. If selected a value higher

     valid map in your maps folder. The [B]filename[/B] argument indicates specifies the name
     to be used for the new file.  It will be created in the [COLOR="Blue"][B]./configs/galileo/[/B][/COLOR] folder.


 [*] Command '[COLOR="Blue"][B]gal_changelevel[/B][/COLOR]', To immediately change level to the current map at
     the [COLOR="Blue"][B]cvar nextmap[/B][/COLOR]. If the next map is set to `[not yet voted on]` the map will
     be changed the next map on the map cycle.


 [*] [COLOR="Blue"][B]The Maintenance Mode[/B][/COLOR]:
     If the owner of the server is fixing something or updating the server and doesn't wanna the map
     to be changed, he will enable the maintenance command '[B]gal_command_maintenance[/B]', so the map
     can't be changed by any method like gal_startvote/rtv/timeleft or maxrounds ended... and will displayed
     a print chat with something like that: You cannot change the map when the server is in mode maintenance.


 [*] [COLOR="Blue"][B]New Recent Maps List[/B][/COLOR]:
     Maps are commonly repeated on the vote and there is no chance for all of them. Hence on server
     to get to play on, you need the use the '[B]gal_banrecent[/B]' to ban these 1000+ maps. Because of this,
     players can't nominate maps for few days. [COLOR="Red"]The proposition[/COLOR] is adding a file to the plugin, in which
     will save map history and a bunch of recent maps won't be able to get automatically displayed on
     the voting menu, but still be able to get nominated.

     This is automatically done, it will not allow to repeat maps on the voting list until all them to be
     showed at least once. The cvar '[B]gal_recent_nom_maps[/B]' control whether this feature is activated
     or not. See it on the 'galileo.cfg' file.

     When the banned maps list is bigger than all maps on the server, what happens?
     It stops counting/using the recent banned list maps and randonly to start adding banned maps.


 [*] [COLOR="Blue"][B]The Half-File cvar 'mp_fraglimit' Support[/B][/COLOR]:
     Enable virtual support for the [COLOR="Blue"]Half-File[/COLOR] cvar '[B]mp_fraglimit[/B]' on game modes as '[COLOR="Red"]Counter-Strike[/COLOR]' which
     do not support the cvar 'mp_fraglimit'. You need to configure the 'mp_fraglimit' as you configure the
     'mp_timelimit' cvar on you 'server.cfg' file. See the cvar '[B]gal_mp_fraglimit_support[/B]' on the
     'galileo.cfg' configuration file.


 [*] [COLOR="Blue"][B]The Map Groups Feature[/B][/COLOR]:
     It uses whatever file you have set in the cvar '[B]gal_vote_mapfile[/B]'. Normally, in that
     file you would just have a listing of maps, one per line. But to use the groups feature,
     your '[B]gal_vote_mapfile[/B]' cvar would point to a '.txt' file looking something like this
     instead:
     [CODE]
[groups]
2
1
1
3
     [/CODE]The text "[B][groups][/B]" has to be the very first line in the file, on a line by itself. The
     numbers, on separate lines, specifies how many maps from each file to add to the
     voting menu.

     If you had a file within what was posted above, then you would have to create the
     files: '[B]1.ini[/B]', '[B]2.ini[/B]', '[B]3.ini[/B]', and '[B]4.ini[/B]' in the '[B]./configs/galileo/[/B]' folder. Each of
     those INI files would contain a list of maps, one per line.

     Galileo will first load any nominated maps into the vote. Then Galileo would pick 2
     maps from '[B]1.ini[/B]', 1 from '[B]2.ini[/B]', 1 from '[B]3.ini[/B]', and 3 from '[B]4.ini[/B]' 'til the maximum
     value of 8 to be reached.

     [B]Another example[/B]:
     If you want to always show the map '[COLOR="Blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]' on the map voting, just use:
     [CODE]
[groups]
1
7
     [/CODE]This maps groups configuration means to load [COLOR="red"]up to 1 map[/COLOR] from the file '[B]1.ini[/B]'
     (1st line after [B][groups][/B]) and [COLOR="red"]up to 7 maps[/COLOR] from '[B]2.ini[/B]' (2nd line after [B][groups][/B]).

     Then you only need to create the files '[B]1.ini[/B]' and '[B]2.ini[/B]' in the '[B]./configs/galileo/[/B]'
     folder. And in the file '[B]1.ini[/B]' you put only the '[COLOR="Blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]' map, and in the file '[B]2.ini[/B]'
     you put your mapcycle or voting filler maps file list.

     Hence the map '[COLOR="Blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]' will always be available on any voting. It only will not be
     displayed, if and only if, the nominations are enabled and there are [COLOR="Blue"][B]1 + 7[/B][/COLOR] map
     nominations and none of them is '[COLOR="blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]'. The map '[COLOR="Blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]' will not be loaded
     on this case because the maximum maps available on any voting is [COLOR="Blue"][B]1 + 7 = 8[/B][/COLOR].
     And as the map nominations are loaded before filling the map voting list using the
     map fillers from your map groups files '[B]1.ini[/B]' (1st line after [B][groups][/B]) and '[B]2.ini[/B]'
     (2nd line after [B][groups][/B]), the map '[COLOR="blue"]de_dust2[/COLOR]' will not be added because there is not
     enough space.


 [*] [COLOR="Blue"][B]The Whitelist Feature[/B][/COLOR]:
     If uses whatever file you set on the cvar '[B]gal_vote_whitelist_mapfile[/B]' as the
     Whitelist. It specifies the time where its listed maps are allowed to be added to
     the voting list as fillers after the [B]nominations[/B] being loaded.

     The Whitelist must follow this pattern:
     [CODE]
[10-22]
de_dust2
de_inferno

[23-05]
de_tuscan_mgc
de_mirage

[05-10]
de_dust2_long
     [/CODE] The maps following '[B][10-22][/B]' will be only allowed to be vote map fillers between
     10:00:00 and 22:59:59 o'clock. This feature should be helpful because some servers have
     about only 10 players between 05:00 and 10:00 o'clock, so they will be needing [COLOR="Blue"]small
     maps[/COLOR] for playing. Basically, the Whitelist is a filter to your mapcycle/filler list.

     It is an whitelist:
     [URL="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitelist"] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitelist[/URL]

     It is a list to specifies the time where the maps are [B][COLOR="Blue"]allowed[/COLOR][/B].
     It is not a list to specifies the time where the maps are [B][COLOR="red"]blocked[/COLOR][/B] (directly).

     So, instead of to think on which time you want to [B][COLOR="red"]block[/COLOR][/B] them.
     To think on which time you want to [B][COLOR="Blue"]allow[/COLOR][/B] them.

     Using [10-22], means:

     1) You want to [B][COLOR="Blue"]allow[/COLOR][/B] them between 10:00:00 hours (morning) until 22:59:59 (night).
     2) Doing it, will cause to [B][COLOR="red"]block[/COLOR][/B] them between 22:00:00 (today night), until 09:59:59 (tomorrow morning).
     3) If the cvar 'gal_whitelist_block_out' = 1, it will always [B][COLOR="red"]block[/COLOR][/B] all maps not following any rules as [10-21], [3-11], etc.
     4) If the cvar 'gal_whitelist_block_out' = 0, it will always [B][COLOR="Blue"]allow[/COLOR][/B] all maps not following any rules as [10-21], [3-11], etc.

     Hence,
     [LIST=1]
     [*]If you try to play 'de_dust' / 'de_inferno' when it is [B]09[/B] hours, you will be [COLOR="Red"]blocked[/COLOR].
     [*]If you try to play 'de_dust' / 'de_inferno' when it is [B]10[/B] hours, you will be [COLOR="Blue"]allowed[/COLOR].
     [*]If you try to play 'de_dust' / 'de_inferno' when it is [B]21[/B] hours, you will be [COLOR="Blue"]allowed[/COLOR].
     [*]If you try to play 'de_dust' / 'de_inferno' when it is [B]22[/B] hours, you will be [COLOR="Blue"]allowed[/COLOR].
     [*]If you try to play 'de_dust' / 'de_inferno' when it is [B]23[/B] hours, you will be [COLOR="Red"]blocked[/COLOR].
     [*]and so on...
     [/LIST]

     To block them between 10-22, change your config file to:
     [code]
[22-10]
de_dust2
de_inferno
     [/code]
     Now [10-10] stands for from 10:00:00 until 10:59:59.
     Now [10-11] stands for from 10:00:00 until 11:59:59.
     Now [5-3] stands for from 5:00:00 (yesterday/today) until 3:59:59 (today/tomorrow).
     Now [1-23] stands for from 1:00:00 until 23:59:59.
     Now [1-22] stands for from 1:00:00 until 22:59:59.
     Now [0-23] stands for from 0:00:00 until 23:59:59.
     And so on...

[*]Fixed issue whereas Galileo would set the time limit to 0 in the course of it's regular
    activities but then sometimes not reset it to the original time limit afterwards.
[*]No longer tries to print menus in color if the game mod doesn't support colored menus.
[*]Fixed possible RTV exploit by introducing a delay before a single player can RTV after a
    map change. It's the lesser of either 2 minutes or the value of gal_rtv_wait.
[*]Added additional information to comments for gal_nom_mapfile, gal_vote_mapfile, and
    gal_emptyserver_mapfile in galileo.cfg.
[*]Changed default for gal_nom_prefixes from 1 to 0. In other words, the prefix functionality
    will be turned off by default.
[*]Will no longer overwrite an existing menu. This means if a player has another menu open when
    the map vote starts, they won't see the map vote until the other menu is closed. It also means
    that, after a player voted and if the server is showing the vote progress, if another menu
    overwrites Galileo's, the progress won't be shown again until the other menu has been closed.
    This only affects people that show the in-progress vote status.
[*]Now obeys a setting of "0" for gal_endofmapvote. Would previously erroneously present a vote
    regardless of the setting.
[*]New CVAR, gal_sounds_mute, to indicate if any of the sentences spoken during various events are
    muted. See galileo.cfg for more information.
[*]Added code to handle automated version info from SVN. This is of no consequence to anyone but
    me really, but I wanted to include it in the change log since it actually involves a change
    to the code.
[*]Removed benign code that was prepped for feature utilizing standard maps of each mod. There
    is no longer any plans to add any information regarding standard maps as I see no use for it.
[*]Removed the following language keys:
    GAL_STANDARD_NOTFOUND
    GAL_STANDARD_TOOMANY
    GAL_STANDARD_UNKNOWNMOD
[*]Fixed the "vote filler groups" feature that was previously working incorrectly.

If you are [B]posting[/B] because the plugin or a [B]feature[/B] of the plugin isn't working for you, [B]please[/B] do
all of the following, so we can [COLOR="Blue"]more efficiently[/COLOR] figure out what's going on:

[LIST=1]
[*]You can enable the DEBUG_LEVEL on 16, instead of 0, as default. [URL="https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=273019#Development"]See here how[/URL] to do it. After that,
to install the plugin, let your server run until the problem you are experiencing happens and after
that send me by PM or post here log file '[COLOR="Blue"]_galileo.log[/COLOR]'. It will be at the folder '[COLOR="blue"]addons/amxmodx/logs[/COLOR]'.

The file '[COLOR="Blue"]_galileo.log[/COLOR]' will be very helpful to find out why it is not working.
You current plugin is not creating the file log file '[COLOR="Blue"]_galileo.log[/COLOR]', only the one with the debugging
log enabled, as I explained above with the DEBUG_LEVEL 16 constant inside the plugin.


[*]If you have access to your [COLOR="Blue"][B]game server's console[/B][/COLOR], type the [COLOR="Red"][B]following[/B][/COLOR] commands in the server console:
[LIST]
[*]status
[*]version
[*]meta list
[*]amxx list

If you don't have access the your game server's console, join your server and type the [COLOR="Red"][B]following[/B][/COLOR]

[/LIST]
People just saying it is broken/lagging and do not help providing the requested information at the main's page
[goanchor=Support]Support[/goanchor] section, will be ignored.

I am not asking to you write code, I asking to just copy and paste something from your server. Then if you
cannot neither do just such a simple thing, it will be broken for ever or until you fix by yourself, or until
someday I/or someone else notice your problem on my/their server and copy and paste what I am asking.

If you cannot help me figure out what is wrong with the plugin, it is definitely not my problem, but it is all
your problem as, you will need to use it bugged or not use at all. Which is not relevant, you should use whatever
work better for your server, if you can find such. At least on my server it is working fine and I do not see
anything wrong with it. But if you are finding and fixing bugs and not releasing/sharing  it, this is not good
from you to the others at all. Would you like I never shared the source code? That depends, if you got something
which works much better for your server, then this plugin is pretty much irrelevant to you and you would not care
whether I shared my coding or not.

Basically, I am assuming anyone which posts problems here and do not provide the requested information as trollers. Because:
[LIST=1]
[*]I do not run a server where I can test behavior related to a running voting within several people.
[*]I am not a magician or psychic to guess your server environment or how the plugin is behaving if you do not provide it.
[*]Until now I was able to fix everything reported by users which collaborate.

Maybe he's tired of supporting them. Maybe he doesn't use those anymore so it
doesn't make sense for him to support them. You can fork them if you like. You
could be the next maintainer as it is open source.

It takes time to support repos. Supporting repos is work. I know because I
support a bunch. It is often a thankless job. People always want something, but
often don't want to put in effort to contribute (even if it's just a simple
donation). People don't like to read the documentation and love to ask a
question you've documented and answered hundreds of times. People don't like to
follow instructions you give them to get your support.

With that said, there are people who do contribute. And there are those who
occasionally give thanks (sometimes verbally and sometimes with donations and
sometimes with pull requests). Those are the people that usually give repo
maintainers the motivation to keep supporting the project.

In short, sometimes it can just get tiring. And if you've moved on from your
