## Galileo Bug and Issue Tracker

### The issue list

Head straight to https://github.com/evandrocoan/Galileo/issues for a list of all issues or click
`Issues` in the navigation bar on the almost-top.

Use [Github's reactions feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments)
to vote on issues. Future "+1" comments with no further content will be deleted without notice.


#### Issues types:

1. `S: blocker` are the bugs we need to fix immediately. These are the bugs that will prevent the
product from working if it were released in that state.
1. `S: critical` issues are bugs, but there is typically a workaround or a quick fix that can be
applied post-release.
1. `S: major` issues have a workaround and can be put off without impacting the functionality of
the application.
1. `S: minor` issues are small bugs/issues which require a small or real complex/big code changes to be
fixed.
1. `S: trivial` issues are usually reserved for enhancements as "nice to haves" or bugs which
require almost zero code changes to be fixed.

[How do you define the severity (critical/high/low etc) of bugs?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2469178/how-do-you-define-the-severity-critical-high-low-etc-of-bugs)


#### Prefixes used around the Issues

1. The prefix `S: `, is supposed to mean the Issue's `Severity`. 
1. The prefix `T: `, is supposed to mean the Issue's `Type`. 
1. The prefix `R: `, is supposed to mean the Issue's `Resolution`. 




### Before creating a new issue

* Search for the issue [here](https://github.com/evandrocoan/Galileo/search?q=&type=Issues) to 
check if it was already reported. You may use labels for filtering the
[issue list](https://github.com/evandrocoan/Galileo/issues) by clicking any of these related
to the problem you want to report or request.




### Filing a bug

1.  Start with a descriptive but concise **subject** that quickly and uniquely identifies the problem.
*   Write a **summary** of the problem in a few lines, giving an idea of what the issue is about.
*   Then, **describe** the bug with all the information you can give.

    Also keep in mind to clearly separate fact from speculation.
*   Try to find a way to **reproduce** the problem and write down precise steps. It might be useful to include a *code example* for this.
*   Workarounds or other related tips on how to avoid the issue are welcome.

We won't slaughter you if you can't fulfill all of these steps, but prepare to answer a few questions if we think we're lacking information.

If you want to be really good at reporting bugs, you can also read **these guidelines** for bugzilla bugs:

1. [Bugzilla – Bug Writing Guidelines](https://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-5.0-branch/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html)
1. [Bugzilla User Guide- Reporting a New Bug](http://bugzilla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/filing.html)
1. [Sourceware Bugzilla – Bug Writing Guidelines](https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html)
1. [Mozilla Software - Bug Writing Guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Bug_writing_guidelines)




### Filing an enhancement or a feature request

1.  Start with a descriptive but concise **subject** that quickly and uniquely identifies the issue.
*   Explain briefly what the enhancement is and why you think it would be useful.
*   Provide any other necessary or useful information regarding your issue, such as (code) examples or related links.

Note: "enhancements" are modifications to existing behavior as opposed to something entirely new.
