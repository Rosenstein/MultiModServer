//Adding and removing maps from your server has never been this easy.
//With AMX Map Handler you just put the maps into your server and don't
//have to worry about editing mapcycle.txt or maps.ini, since this is
//done automatically.
//
//Maps.ini is used by the Mapchooser ("Time to choose!") and the Mapsmenu plugins.
//
//Mapcycle.txt is updated with a console command, and maps.ini is updated
//on every map startup. Because of this it is important that you put the
//amx file of this BEFORE mapchooser.amx and mapsmenu.amx in your plugins.ini,
//or you will have to restart map two times before you can see the newly added
//maps.
//After your first run you can open up maps.ini to change the default
//name of each map (that's within the quotes). If you remove commented maps
//from server for a while, and then put them back, AMX Map Handler will remember
//the map name as you typed it. Nifty, eh?
//The default name of a map is its file name.
//
//But wait, there's more. If you download within 15 minutes, we'll add
//this nifty map listing command (amx_listmaps) that has the look and feel of the
//amx_help command. It completely replaces the client "listmaps" command (which can overflow the client!), and also
//works on server console.
