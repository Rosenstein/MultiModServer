//After researching a lot on a variety of forums, I could not
//   find what i needed to customize my server for Winter. Instead
//   of installing 100 plugins, I created an AIO one!
//   With this plugin you can bring the Christmas Environment to
//   your Counter Strike server! Very customizable, this plugin
//   unique style is beyond all the existing Christmas plugins here.
//   I know there are a LOT of plugins for winter here, but most of
//   them aren't complete, or they contain bugs. Well in this plugin
//   I tried to create an All-In-One Winter plugin that includes
//   almost all the functionalities for a Christmas Server! Merry
//   Christmas everyone!
//   What does this plugin contains?
//     * Gun Snowball Bullets
//     * Custom Sky name for the Christmas Environment
//     * Custom Darkness on the map, to make it more Environmental
//       (enables mp_flashlight server cvar)
//     * Custom Christmas Bomb Sounds (Planted, Exploded, Defused)
//     * Custom BOMB replacement
//     * Weather Menu (For those who do not have cl_weather cvar
//       enabled. Plugin offers to set it up for the user, asking
//       USER PERMISSION. No slow-hacking)
//
//     * An AWESOME coloured musical tree on each team spawn that
//       plays music and have lightning styles (YEAH!)
//     * Santa Hat for each player, or Admin only.
//     * Picking up presents, somethimes you get GLOW on your SANTA
//       HAT (HECK YEAH!)
//     * Better models, a variety of customizations and model
//       replacements (Christmas Themed, Grenades, Knife, Bomb)
//     * Candy Cane knife replacement with player model ! WOAH.
//     * Players will drop Presents when they die!
//     * Support for maps that has rain built in! (adding snow
//       environment instead of rain)
//     * FUN! FUN! FUN!
//     * A variety of configurations, including it's own config
//       file!
//     * To see what kind of presents you can pick up, read the
//       configuration file!
//     * Grenade glow and trails, customizable by 3 different types:
//       1. All grenades trail/glow is white, 2. HE has red
//       glow/trail, FB has blue glow/trail and SG has green
//       trail/glow. 3. All grenades have random glow/trail colours
//
//   Why is it so unique?
//     * Has a lot of Half-Life resources
//     * Up to date
//     * Own configuration file, with a variety of customizable
//       cvars

//       spawns!
