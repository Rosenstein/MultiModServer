//Introduction:
//This is a Counter-Strike 1.6 mod where the hiders (Terrorists) must hide from the seekers (Counter-Terrorists) until the round ends.
//The teams will swap when the Counter-Terrorists win, or when X rounds have ended (cvar to change).
//The hiders are equipped with a broken, invisible knife (cvar), an HE grenade (cvar), two flashbangs (cvar), and a smokegrenade (cvar).
//The seekers are equipped with a knife (cvars for grenades).
//Both teams are given 100 armor (cvars per team).
//
//Features:
//Removes all objectives (bombs, hostages, etc.) and doors
//Creates a fake hostage outside of the map to end the rounds.
//Removes any guns placed on the ground in special maps, such as awp_map.
//Contains two different scrim mods
//More features are described with the cvars and commands.
//
//Scrim Mods:
//Win Rounds
//This scrim mod is based upon winning and losing rounds.
//When your team is hiding, they must win X rounds in a row.
//If you lose before winning those rounds, the teams will switch and the opposite team will have a chance.
//If the teams keep switching enough times, the scrim will end.
//Point System
//This scrim mod is based upon gameplay, and earning points for how well you play.
//You can receive points for killing and winning the round.
//You can lose points for suiciding, team killing, and losing the round.
//There is a set amount of rounds to play throughout the scrim.
//After half of these rounds have passed, the teams will switch.
//After all the rounds have ended, whichever team has the most points, wins.

//   Plugin API:
//
//     You can now add custom items for weapon chance from other
//     plugins.
//     This can be useful for plugins that enhance existing weapons
//     like FrostNades or Heat-Seeking grenades.
//     Attached is the weapon_chance.inc file which contains the
//     functions used for these features.
//     The plugins which use this include must be after
//     weapon_chance.amxx in the plugins.ini.
//     Also, these plugins must be [31]compiled locally with this
//     include.
//     For an example on using the plugin API, you can see the
//     wc_item_example.sma file attached.
//     For details on the functions, please read the include file
//     first.
//
//   Any questions asked that can be answered with information from
//   this post will be ignored.

//This addon turns your grenades into frost grenades. When hit by the blast, you have a 
//large chance to be chilled, reducing your movement speed, and a smaller chance to be 
//frozen in place completely. The closer you are to the center of the blast, the higher 
//your chances are of getting chilled or frozen. The frost grenade also deals minimal damage.
//
//      Forwards:
//      This plugin creates the following two forwards which can be
//      used by other plugins:
//      PHP Code:
//      /* victim is being chilled by attacker.
//       * attacker is not guaranteed to be connected. */
//      public frostnades_player_chilled( victim, attacker );
//      /* victim is being frozen by attacker.
//       * attacker is not guaranteed to be connected. */
//      public frostnades_player_frozen( victim, attacker );
//      These forwards occur before the actual effects, so you may
//      return PLUGIN_HANDLED in either of these forwards to stop them.

//This plugin was inspired by FatalisDKs bunnyhop course maker (BCM).
//Thanks to SpaceDude for the basics of the grab code from his JediGrab plugin.
//
//I made this for use on hide n seek servers but of course you can use it however you please!
//
//Features:
//- Say /bm in chat to bring up the main menu.
//- Bind a key to +bmgrab to move the blocks around.
//- While grabbing a block, press attack1 to copy a block, attack2 to delete, jump to move a 
// block closer, and duck to move a block further away.
//- Create a block by aiming at the floor or a wall.
//- Convert block you are aiming at to the selected block type.
//- Delete block you are aiming at.
//- Rotate the block you are aiming at.
//- Optional noclip and godmode to make creating blocks easier.
//- Snapping option so when creating and moving blocks, they snap into place next to, above or below other nearby blocks. 
//- Snapping gap option to leave a gap between blocks when they snap together.
//- Save all blocks to file using mapname, will load on map load. Save folder: \amxmodx\blockmaker\
//- In game plugin help including server CVAR values.
//- Look at a block to see what type of block it is.
//- Server Ops can edit the 'blockmaker_models.ini' file to specify alternative block models and rendering
//
//Block types:
//- Platform (A platform you can stand on)
//- Bunnyhop (A platform that disappears for a short period of time after touching it)
//- Damage (Hurts you if you stand on top of it)
//- Healer (Heals you if you stand on top of it)
//- No Fall Damage (You don't take any damage if you fall onto it)
//- Ice (You slide around like you're on ice)
//- Trampoline (Throws you up in the air)
//- Speed Boost (Throws you forwards in the direction you're looking)
//- Invincibility (Player becomes invincible for a set amount of time)
//- Stealth (Player becomes invisible for a set amount of time)
//- Death (Player dies instantly)
//- Nuke (Destroys all players on the other team unless a player has invincibility)
//- Camouflage (Player looks like the other team for a set amount of time)
//- Low Gravity (Jumping from this block you get low gravity until you land) (Thanks C$L for idea)
//- Fire (Another damage block but nicer looking) =)
//- Slap (You get slapped!) (Pat made this one)
//- Random (Random between Invincibility, Stealth, Camouflage, Boots Of Speed, a slap, or death!)
//- Honey (Player moves slowly like they're stuck in honey) (Thanks C$L for idea)
//- CT Barrier (Only Terrorists can pass through these blocks, acts as solid for Counter-Terrorists)
//- T Barrier (Only Counter-Terrorists can pass through these blocks, acts as solid for Terrorists)
//- Boots Of Speed (Player runs fast for a set amount of time)
//- Glass (Same as platform but looks like a transparent pane of glass)
//- Bunnyhop - No slow down (Same as bunnyhop block but you don't slow down after landing)
//- Auto bunnyhop (Player can hold jump to auto bunnyhop for 'bm_autobhoptime' amount of time)
//
//Changing Block Models:
//- New in version 3.60 is the ability to change the block models and the rendering of the blocks without editing the code.
//- To do this, edit the file called 'blockmaker_models.ini' in the '/amxmodx/configs/' folder.
//- Each line in the file can have a maximum of 7 parameters separated by white space.
//- The 1st is the ID of the block, 2nd is the path and filename of the model, 3rd is the rendering type, 4th, 5th, 6th & 7th are the
//- red, green, blue and alpha values for various glowing styles.
//- The path to the model is relative to the '/cstrike/' folder. Folders in the path can be separated with either / or \.
//- If you want to use the default block model but want to change the rendering of it then use 'DEFAULT' as the path.
//- If at any time no information is specified or is invalid then default values are used.
//- The different rendering types are:
//- 
//- 	GLOWSHELL	-	Solid model with a glowing shell (The invincibility block uses this with white colour values and alpha 16)
//- 	TRANSCOLOR	-	Transparent model with a glowing shell (No default block uses this rendering type)
//- 	TRANSALPHA	-	Transparent model (By default the glass block looks like this with an alpha of 50)
//- 	TRANSWHITE	-	Bright white transparent model (By default the stealth block looks like this with an alpha of 100)
//- 
//- The TRANSALPHA and TRANSWHITE rendering types do not make use of the red, green and blue values.
//- Here is a short example of a 'blockmaker_models.ini' file:
//
//PLATFORM	models/blockmaker/myblock_platform.mdl GLOWSHELL 0 255 0 16
//BHOP		models/blockmaker/myblock_bhop2.mdl TRANSALPHA 255 255 255 150
//DAMAGE		models/steves_dmg_block.mdl
//HEALER		DEFAULT GLOWSHELL 0 0 255 16
//
//- The platform block would use a different model in the '/models/blockmaker/' folder and would glow green with a magnitude of 16.
//- The bhop block would use a different model in the '/models/blockmaker/' folder and would be semi-transparent with an alpha of 150.
//- The damage block would use a different model in the '/models/' folder and wouldn't glow at all.
//- The healer block would use the default model and would glow blue with a magnitude of 16.
//- All other blocks would use their hard-coded default values.
//- The speed boost, trampoline and fire blocks will always have their sprites on top.
//- The only blocks with default rendering are the invincibility, stealth and glass blocks.
//- The plugin will automatically look for models with filename suffixed with _large and _small for the larger and smaller blocks.
