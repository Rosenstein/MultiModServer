I know there are other ones out there. but basically.. They suck!
Ive been working on this one for a while and it seems to be a hit. People are enjoying it, and its actually challenging.

Description:
*1 pred(T) vs all the humans(CT)
*you kill the pred, you become the pred.
*if the pred fails to eliminate everyone, commits suicide, or leaves, a random person will be selected.
*Dark

Predator:
*Predator is invisible (completely invisible at a certian distance, then his opacity is calculated depending on distance to its individual target)
*Predator's cloak fails when injured, but it fixes itself quickly
*The predator is only able to use the knife, and 'ground pound'. a shockwave that can be used as a last resort to injure and disorientate campers/groups of people.
*Everything the predator does runs off energy. the less he has, the less he can do.
*The predator can also jump far/high, and cling to objects, and jump from wall to wall with ease.
*Also the predator can eat bodies to gain health.
*Sweet view

Humans:
*Smoke grenades sometimes help
*Better flashlight
*Good luck 

I can't list everything. Basically it stands out from all the rest in every way. I haven't seen anything like this before.

Keys:
Duck = stick to walls (holding forward cancels this out. makes it easyer to climb into vents/small oppenings without sticking to it)
Duck+Jump = jump far (not item_longjump)
Reload = Ground pound
Use = Eat corpses (look at there feet)
Radio1-3 = Predator crys - Arnold sayings
Flashlight key = Disable/Enable cloak - Flashlight

The sounds/models are included in the zip file below. Ive also included a custom buymenu in the .zip. it allows you to buy things from any team. No .sma included. Use at your own risk.
