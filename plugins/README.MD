This project use/try to follow the gitflow: http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

###The gitflow do not merge/commit things to master branch, it is done to the 'develop' branch.
To contribute, fork this project and checkout to the 'develop' branch to proceed with your updates. The master branch is updated over an new plugin official release, while the 'develop' branch receives/stores all the updates which are waiting to be released on the next version. The updates to the 'develop' branch are usually done by merging into it, feature branches. Such approaches are well explained on gitflow tutorials, as the one just above.
