// Files: 
//   $game/addons/amxx/configs/sounds.cfg 
//                      This file is executed on loading of this plugin. It 
//                      should initialize the sound matrix. 
// 
// Configuration file: This file contains mappings between 
// keywords and sound files to play. It should contain commands like the 
// following examples: 
// 
// pd_sound "ha ha" "misc/haha.wav" 
// pd_sound "doh"   "misc/doh.wav" 
// pd_sound "doh"   "misc/doh2.wav" 
// 
// So if a players says "ha ha", the sound file haha.wav will be played to all 
// players. If a player says "doh", randomly one of the two sounds doh.wav and 
// doh2.wav will be played. The matching is case sensitive. Make sure says 
// containing spaces (like "ha ha") are enclosed in quotes.
