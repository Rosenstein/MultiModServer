//Active, ??But you risk more, but the last heros the list below:
// Zeus, xavier, ..., will not appear in the selection list, however, may continue
// Cause the server to not open, or gerarar overflow errors.
//
// That's why unfortunately the game is limited to a maximum of 512 features:
// FATAL ERROR (shutting down): Host_Error: PF_precache_sound_I:
// Sound 'squeek / sqk_blast1.wav' failed to precache because the item count is over
// The 512 limit. Reduce the number of brush models and / or regular models in the map
// To correct this.
//
// So you can perhaps turn one, for every one turn.
// However, Some that you turn in place of others, can allocate more resources
// And so the server can exceed the limit of 512.
//
// Remember that the server usually closes the map exchange.
// And in other cases direct closes on first boot.

// There are currently 75 activated heros (limit is 80).
