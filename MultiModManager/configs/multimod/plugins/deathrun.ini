//This plugin allow Terrorists on deathrun maps to lock buttons by looking them and use a knife attack,
//aka when a player has locked a button, he is the only one who can use
//this button, unless a certain time has passed, or he has locked another button,
//or he has gone too far from the button.

//This plugin fixes the anoying bug in linux, where the func_rotating stops (visualy) rotating after 10/20 minutes.
//This is a Must-Have for any custom maps linux servers with rotatings in it.

//This plugin was mainly done for deathrun servers, did you had situation when you are 
//terrorist and pressing button, then cts die, and in new round the button is still red? this 
//plugin is for you, it makes all buttons to be usable at new round aka resets buttons / makes 
//them green.
ResetButtons.amxx


//This plugin is very simple and small.
//Impulse commands are only executable while the player is able to shoot. More technically: 
//only executable while gpGlobals->time is greater than m_flNextAttack. This plugin lets 
//players execute impulse commands (like impulse 100 for flashlight) and +use during some 
//events that it is disabled because of what's said above. These events include reloading 
//and changing weapons.
//Written because one of my Steam friends requested it. Don't really expect it to be approved, 
//but someone might find it useful. Probably most useful for deathrun and kreedz servers with 
//timers, as it removes the need to wait your weapon to reload to start/end the timer.
