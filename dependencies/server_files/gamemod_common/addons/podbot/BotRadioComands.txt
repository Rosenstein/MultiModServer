Summary of Bot Reactions to Radio Commands
	Follow me - Forces Bots in the near to follow you. You can specify 
the maximum number of bots following in the podbot.cfg by the cvar 
pb_numfollowuser (defaults to 3).
	Hold this Position - Makes a Bot who's following you, stay a while 
at that position and look around for enemies.
	Taking Fire, need assistance - Makes all living Bots (not engaged in 
a Fight) run to your position to assist you.
	Need Backup - Basically the same as above, but limited to distance 
and also the Bots use it sometimes to get some support.
	Storm the Front! - Mighty command! Forces all Bots in the near to rush 
in the direction you're pointing to when using that command. Basically 
their level of aggression is increased so a pathetic frightened Bot could 
also turn around and flee.
	Get in position... - Bots in the near will try to take a covered position 
and stay there until they either encounter an enemy, you order them to 
leave, or they waited too long.
	Go,go,go - If a Bot follows you, this commands stops him from 
following. If there are other Bots in the near, they will stop camping 
and going to roam the map again (normally used in combination with 
"Get in position...")
	Team, Fall Back! - Opposite of " Storm the Front". Increases Fear 
and decreases aggression of Bots in the near so that they are more 
likely to fall back and stay covered for a short period.
