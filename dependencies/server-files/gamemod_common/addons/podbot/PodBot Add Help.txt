Bot Personalities
There are 3 different Personalities in POD now, if you have 'pb_detailnames' turned 
on they are shown through the Prefixes like this:
[P*D] = Agressive Bot
[POD] = Normal Bot
[P0D] = Defensive Bot
These personalities affect bot's buying system, they influent taking the decision 
about paths (more aggresive bots take shortest paths, normal bots care about the 
history (danger of the path) and the distance, deffensive bots are taking the most 
safe paths. You can specify which one type of personlity has to be added to the game 
by pb add command (or pb fillserver or from podbotmenu) .
